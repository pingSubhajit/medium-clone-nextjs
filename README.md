### Idea behind using Next.Js

Next.Js is a React framework that is used to create server-side rendered applications. It is a very powerful tool
that can be used to create static websites, server-side rendered websites, and also single page applications. It is
very easy to use and has a lot of features that can be used to create a very powerful application.

- **Industry standard**: React is hardly used in production in industries where the product is the web application
  itself.Next.Js is an industry standard for creating React applications.
- **Server-side rendering**: Next.Js is used to create server-side rendered applications. This means that the server
  will render the page and send it to the client. This is very useful for SEO purposes as the search engines can
  easily crawl the website and index it.
- **Full stack capabilities**: Next.Js has full stack capabilities. This means that you can create both the front-end
  and the back-end of the application using Next.Js. You can create APIs, connect to databases, and do a lot more
  using Next.Js.
- **Meaning abstractions**: Next.Js has a lot of abstractions that make it very easy to create applications. You can
  create pages, components, and layouts and play with advanced react features such as React.lazy and suspence without significant overhead.
